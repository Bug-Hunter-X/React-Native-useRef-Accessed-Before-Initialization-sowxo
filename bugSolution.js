The solution involves ensuring that you only access `myRef.current` after the component has mounted and the ref is properly initialized. One way to achieve this is by using the `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array to ensure the effect runs only once after mounting, and checking for a non-null value before using it. 

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (myRef.current) {
      console.log('Ref is now available:', myRef.current);
      // Perform operations on myRef.current here
    }
  }, []);

  const doSomething = () => {
    if(myRef.current) {
        console.log('Ref accessed safely:', myRef.current);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text ref={myRef}>Hello</Text>
      <Button title="Do Something" onPress={doSomething} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

Alternatively, you can access the ref only within methods that are guaranteed to be called after the component mounts. For instance, if you're using the ref to interact with a native module or perform actions on an element after it has been rendered, consider wrapping those methods inside a condition to only run when `myRef.current` is not null.
