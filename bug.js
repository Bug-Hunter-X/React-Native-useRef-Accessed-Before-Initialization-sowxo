This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native and trying to access its current value before it's been initialized.  This commonly happens when you're trying to access the ref's value within a function that's called before the component has fully mounted. For example:

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Attempting to access myRef.current here might be too early
    console.log(myRef.current); 
  }, []);

  const doSomething = () => {
    // Accessing it here is fine, because the component has mounted.
    console.log(myRef.current);
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text ref={myRef}>Hello</Text>
      <Button title="Do Something" onPress={doSomething} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

This will log `null` initially because the ref is not yet attached to the element. Trying to perform operations on it at that point could lead to errors.
